===========

.. _design_app_overview:

Overview
--------

In Nuclei SDK, we just provided applications which can
run in different boards without any changes in code to
demonstrate the baremetal service, freertos service and
ucosii service features.

The provided applications can be divided into three categories:

* Bare-metal applications: Located in ``application/baremetal``

* FreeRTOS applications: Located in ``application/freertos``

* UCOSII applications: Located in ``application/ucosii``

* RTThread applications: Located in ``application/rtthread``

If you want to develop your own application in Nuclei SDK, please click
:ref:`develop_appdev` to learn more about it.

The following applications are running using RV-STAR board.

Bare-metal applications

.. _design_app_demo_eclic:

demo_eclic
~~~~~~~~~~

This `demo_eclic application`_ is used to demonstrate how to use
the ECLIC API and Interrupt.

.. note::

    In this application's Makefile, we provided comments in Makefile about optimize
    for code size.

    If you want to optimize this application for code size, you can set the ``COMMON_FLAGS``
    variable to the following values, we recommend to use ``-Os -flto``.

* The timer interrupt and timer software interrupt are used
* The timer interrupt is registered as non-vector interrupt
* The timer software interrupt is registered as vector interrupt,
  and we enable its preemptive feature by using ``SAVE_IRQ_CSR_CONTEXT``
  and ``RESTORE_IRQ_CSR_CONTEXT`` in timer software interrupt handler
* The timer interrupt is triggered periodically
* The timer software interrupt is triggered in timer interrupt handler using
  ``SysTimer_SetSWIRQ`` function
* In the application code, there is a macro called ``SWIRQ_INTLEVEL_HIGHER`` to
  control the timer software interrupt working feature:

  - If **SWIRQ_INTLEVEL_HIGHER=1**, the timer software interrupt level is higher than
    timer interrupt level, so when timer software interrupt is triggered, then timer
    software interrupt will be processed immediately, and timer interrupt will be preempted
    by timer software interrupt.

  - If **SWIRQ_INTLEVEL_HIGHER=0**, the timer software interrupt level is lower than
    timer interrupt level, so when timer software interrupt is triggered, then timer
    software interrupt will be processed after timer interrupt, and timer interrupt will
    not be preempted by timer software interrupt.

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei SDK environment
    # cd to the demo_eclic directory
    cd application/baremetal/demo_eclic
    # Change macro SWIRQ_INTLEVEL_HIGHER value in demo_eclic.c
    # to see different working mode of this demo
    # Clean the application first
    make SOC=gd32vf103 BOARD=gd32vf103v_rvstar clean
    # Build and upload the application
    make SOC=gd32vf103 BOARD=gd32vf103v_rvstar upload

**Expected output(SWIRQ_INTLEVEL_HIGHER=1) as below:**

.. _design_app_demo_dsp:

demo_dsp
~~~~~~~~

This `demo_dsp application`_ is used to demonstrate how to NMSIS-DSP API.

* Mainly show how we can use DSP library and header files.
* It mainly demo the ``riscv_conv_xx`` functions and its reference functions
* If your Nuclei Processor Core has DSP feature enabled, you can pass extra
  ``DSP_ENABLE=ON`` in your make command to use NMSIS-DSP library with DSP enabled.
* By default, the application will use NMSIS-DSP library with DSP enabled.

.. note::

    * From version 0.2.4, this demo is upgraded to a more complex version which
      shows the usage of ``riscv_conv_xx`` functions, and ``DSP_ENABLE`` is changed
      from ``OFF`` to ``ON`` by default.
    * The GD32VF103 SoC doesn't has DSP enabled, so this SoC can only use NMSIS-DSP
      library with DSP disabled, so please pass extra ``DSP_ENABLE=OFF`` when run make.
    * For other Nuclei Processor Core based SoC, please check whether it has DSP
      feature enabled to decide which kind of **NMSIS-DSP** library to use.
    * Even our NMSIS-DSP library with DSP disabled are also optimized, so it can
      also provide good performance in some functions.

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei SDK environment

.. _design_app_coremark:

coremark
~~~~~~~~

This `coremark benchmark application`_ is used to run EEMBC CoreMark Software.

EEMBC CoreMark Software is a product of EEMBC and is provided under the terms of the
CoreMark License that is distributed with the official EEMBC COREMARK Software release.
If you received this EEMBC CoreMark Software without the accompanying CoreMark License,
you must discontinue use and download the official release from www.coremark.org.

In Nuclei SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``coremark`` application.
You can also optimize the ``COMMON_FLAGS`` defined in coremark application Makefile
to get different score number.

* By default, this application runs for 600 iterations, you can also change this in Makefile.
  e.g. Change this ``-DITERATIONS=600`` to value such as ``-DITERATIONS=5000``
* macro **PERFORMANCE_RUN=1** is defined
* **PFLOAT = 1** is added in its Makefile to enable float value print
* For different Nuclei CPU series, the benchmark options are different, currently
  you can pass ``CPU_SERIES=900`` to select benchmark options for 900 series, otherwise
  the benchmark options for 200/300/600/900 will be selected which is also the default value.

.. note::

   * Since for each SoC platforms, the CPU frequency is different, so user need to change
     the ``ITERATIONS`` defined in Makefile to proper value to let the coremark run at least
     10 seconds
   * For example, for the ``gd32vf103`` based boards supported in Nuclei SDK, we suggest
     to change ``-DITERATIONS=600`` to ``-DITERATIONS=5000``

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei SDK environment
    # cd to the coremark directory
    cd application/baremetal/benchmark/coremark
    # change ITERATIONS value in Makefile for gd32vf103 based board to 5000
    # Clean the application first

.. _design_app_dhrystone:

dhrystone
~~~~~~~~~

This `dhrystone benchmark application`_ is used to run DHRYSTONE Benchmark Software.

The Dhrystone benchmark program has become a popular benchmark for CPU/compiler performance measurement,
in particular in the area of minicomputers, workstations, PC's and microprocesors.

* It apparently satisfies a need for an easy-to-use integer benchmark;
* it gives a first performance indication which is more meaningful than MIPS numbers which,
  in their literal meaning (million instructions per second), cannot be used across different
  instruction sets (e.g. RISC vs. CISC).
* With the increasing use of the benchmark, it seems necessary to reconsider the benchmark and
  to check whether it can still fulfill this function.

In Nuclei SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``dhrystone`` application.
You can also optimize the ``COMMON_FLAGS`` defined in dhrystone application Makefile
to get different score number.

* **PFLOAT = 1** is added in its Makefile to enable float value print
* You can change ``Number_Of_Runs`` in ``dhry_1.c`` line 134 to increate or decrease
  number of iterations

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei SDK environment
    # cd to the dhrystone directory

.. _design_app_whetstone:

whetstone
~~~~~~~~~

This `whetstone benchmark application`_ is used to run C/C++ Whetstone Benchmark Software
(Single or Double Precision).

The Fortran Whetstone programs were the first general purpose benchmarks that set industry
standards of computer system performance. Whetstone programs also addressed the question
of the efficiency of different programming languages, an important issue not covered by
more contemporary standard benchmarks.

In Nuclei SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``whetstone`` application.
You can also optimize the ``COMMON_FLAGS`` defined in whetstone application Makefile
to get different score number.

* **PFLOAT = 1** is added in its Makefile to enable float value print
* Extra **LDFLAGS := -lm** is added in its Makefile to include the math library


**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei SDK environment
    # cd to the whetstone directory
    cd application/baremetal/benchmark/whetstone

.. _design_app_demo_smode_eclic:

demo_smode_eclic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This `demo_smode_eclic application`_ is used to demostrate how to use
the ECLIC API and Interrupt in supervisor mode with TEE.

.. note::

    * In this application's Makefile, we provided comments in Makefile about optimization
      for code size, please refer to chapter :ref:`design_app_demo_eclic` for details.
    * It doesn't work with gd32vf103 processor.
    * Need to enable TEE in <Device.h> if TEE present in CPU.

* The timer interrupt and timer software interrupt are used
* The timer interrupt is registered as non-vector interrupt
* The timer software interrupt is registered as vector interrupt,
  and we enable its preemptive feature by using ``SAVE_IRQ_CSR_CONTEXT_S``
  and ``RESTORE_IRQ_CSR_CONTEXT_S`` in timer software interrupt handler
* The timer interrupt is triggered periodically
* The timer software interrupt is triggered in timer interrupt handler using
  ``SysTimer_SetHartSWIRQ`` function
* Interrupts occur in supervisor mode to which it drops from machine mode, and you can
  observe the difference from :ref:`design_app_demo_eclic` by console output
* In the application code, there is a macro called ``SWIRQ_INTLEVEL_HIGHER`` to
  control the timer software interrupt working feature:

  - If **SWIRQ_INTLEVEL_HIGHER=1**, the timer software interrupt level is higher than
    timer interrupt level, so when timer software interrupt is triggered, then timer
    software interrupt will be processed immediately, and timer interrupt will be preempted
    by timer software interrupt.

  - If **SWIRQ_INTLEVEL_HIGHER=0**, the timer software interrupt level is lower than
    timer interrupt level, so when timer software interrupt is triggered, then timer
    software interrupt will be processed after timer interrupt, and timer interrupt will
    not be preempted by timer software interrupt.

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei SDK environment
    # cd to the demo_smode_eclic directory
    cd application/baremetal/demo_smode_eclic
    # MUST: Your CPU configuration must has TEE configured
    # Change macro __TEE_PRESENT to 1 in <Device.h>
    # here assume CORE=n300 is equipped with TEE
    #define __TEE_PRESENT             1
    # Change macro SWIRQ_INTLEVEL_HIGHER value in demo_smode_eclic.c

.. _design_app_demo_spmp:

demo_spmp
~~~~~~~~~

This `demo_spmp_application`_ is used to demonstrate how to grant physical memory privileges
(read, write, execute) on each physical memory region by supervisor-mode control CSRs.

.. note::

    * It doesn't work with gd32vf103 processor.
    * Need to enable PMP in <Device.h> if PMP present in CPU.
    * Need to enable TEE in <Device.h> if TEE present in CPU.
    * Need to enable SPMP in <Device.h> if SPMP present in CPU.

* ``spmp_violation_fault_handler`` is registered, which is to excute when spmp violation
  exception occurs
* The sPMP values are checked after the physical address to be accessed passes PMP checks
* There're three config structures, ``pmp_config`` inits that M-mode grants full permission
  of the whole address range on S and U mode; ``spmp_config_x`` sets protected executable
  address range as 2^12 bytes; ``spmp_config_rw`` sets protected readable/writable address
  range as 2^12 bytes, and you can change the ``protection``, ``order``, ``base_addr``
  according to your memory assignments
* Exception delegation from default M mode to S mode is also provided in this demo, when
  it violates sPMP check.When exception occurs, the print info including ``scause``, ``sepc``
  can be observed by serial console, which explains the exception cause of SPMP permission
  violation, and shows which asm instruction triggers the violation
* In the application code, there is a macro called ``TRIGGER_SPMP_VIOLATION_MODE`` to control the
  sPMP working feature:

  - If **TRIGGER_SPMP_VIOLATION_MODE=INSTRUCTION_FETCH_PAGE_EXCEPTION**, the unallowed memory is to
    excute, which triggers ``Instruction page fault``, whose scause.EXCCODE = 12 and sdcause = 6

  - If **TRIGGER_SPMP_VIOLATION_MODE=LOAD_PAGE_EXCEPTION**, the unallowed memory is to read,
    which triggers ``Load page fault``, whose scause.EXCODE = 13 and sdcause = 6

  - If **TRIGGER_SPMP_VIOLATION_MODE=STORE_PAGE_EXCEPTION**, the unallowed memory is to write,
    which triggers ``Store/AMO page fault``, whose scause.EXCODE = 15 and sdcause = 6

  - If **TRIGGER_SPMP_VIOLATION_MODE=EXECUTE_USERMODE_MEMORY_EXCEPTION**, the U-Mode accessiable
    memory is to execute, which triggers ``Instruction page fault``. By the way, S-mode can never
    execute instructions from user pages, regardless of the state of ``SUM(permit Supervisor User Memory access)``

  - If **TRIGGER_SPMP_VIOLATION_MODE=LOAD_USERMODE_MEMORY_EXCEPTION**, the the U-Mode accessiable
    memory is to read, which triggers ``Load page fault``. When SUM=1, read access is permitted

  - If **TRIGGER_SPMP_VIOLATION_MODE=STORE_USERMODE_MEMORY_EXCEPTION**, the the U-Mode accessiable
    memory is to write, which triggers ``Store/AMO page fault``. When SUM=1, write access is permitted

  - If **TRIGGER_SPMP_VIOLATION_MODE=RUN_WITH_NO_SPMP_CHECK**, supervisor mode access succeed, no
    violation occurs

.. _design_app_demo_pmp:

demo_pmp
~~~~~~~~

This `demo_pmp_application`_ is used to demonstrate how to grant physical memory privileges
(read, write, execute) on each physical memory region by machine mode control CSRs.

.. note::

    * Need to enable PMP in <Device.h> if PMP present in CPU.

* ``pmp_violation_fault_handler`` is registered, which is to excute when pmp violation
  exception occurs
* There're two config structures, ``pmp_config_x`` sets protected executable address range
  as 2^12 bytes; ``pmp_config_rw`` sets protected readable/writable address range as 2^12
  bytes, and you can change the ``protection``, ``order``, ``base_addr`` according to your
  memory assignments
* When exception occurs, the print info including ``mcause``, ``mepc`` can be observed
  by serial console, which explains the exception cause of PMP permission violation, and
  shows which asm instruction triggers the violation
* In the application code, there is a macro called ``TRIGGER_PMP_VIOLATION_MODE`` to control the
  PMP working feature:

  - If **TRIGGER_PMP_VIOLATION_MODE=INSTRUCTION_FETCH_EXCEPTION**, the unallowed memory is to
    excute, which triggers ``Instruction access fault``, whose mcause.EXCCODE = 1 and mdcause = 1

  - If **TRIGGER_PMP_VIOLATION_MODE=LOAD_EXCEPTION**, the unallowed memory is to read,
    which triggers ``Load access fault``, whose mcause.EXCODE = 5 and mdcause = 1

  - If **TRIGGER_PMP_VIOLATION_MODE=STORE_EXCEPTION**, the unallowed memory is to write,
    which triggers ``Store/AMO access fault``, whose mcause.EXCODE = 7 and mdcause = 1

  - If **TRIGGER_PMP_VIOLATION_MODE=RUN_WITH_NO_PMP_CHECK**,  no violation occurs

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block::shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei SDK environment
    # cd to the demo_pmp directory
    cd application/baremetal/demo_pmp
    # MUST: Your CPU configuration must has PMP configured
    # Change macro __PMP_PRESENT to 1 in <Device.h>
    #define __PMP_PRESENT             1
    # Change macro TRIGGER_PMP_VIOLATION_MODE value in demo_pmp.c
    # to see different working mode of this demo
    # Clean the application first
